Some tools thats simplifies testing of java DAOs. *For now pack includes only dump uploader for mysql and postgresql.*

Simple using. Just put same piece of code to you *@BeforeClass* method:

bq. new DumpLoadHelper("connection.properties", "dump.sql").load();

or if you want to use few dumps:

bq. new DumpLoadHelper("connection.properties", new String[]{"dump1.sql", "dump2.sql", "dump3.sql"}).load();

or in case if your connection.properties file name is "connection.properties" you can remove this parameter because application use it as default file name:

bq. new DumpLoadHelper("dump.sql").load();

*Dump file should be in the classpath.*

Connection properties file looks like this:

bq. connection.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/daotesthelper
connection.username=postgres
connection.password=root

For now should be full connection url including host, port, dbname and engine identifier.

*Of course you must have preinstalled software like psql, createdb, dropdb - for pasgres and mysql, mysqladmin - for mysql. These application should be available from the $PATH*

To use transactional entityManager extend your test class from DaoTestHelper? and simply put

bq. setupEntityManager(persistenceUnitName);

to *@BeforeClass* method after dump loader helper initialization.
